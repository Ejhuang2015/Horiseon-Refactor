# Horiseon-Refactor

The Horiseon-Refactor project is a practice project to learn how to refactor an existing document to meet accessibility standards as well as provide a more comfortable legible structure.

I was given a pre-made website whose HTML and CSS only contained the bare minimum to make the site function. From there, I added comments, changed tags, and reorganized the documents to meet accessibility standards and make it easier to read for others who may work on it in the future.

## Prerequisites

Any web browswer that allows the user to open and view HTML files will do.
